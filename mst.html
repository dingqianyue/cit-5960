        <h1>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h1>
        <h2>MST</h2>
        <p>Given: An undirected weighted connected graph where vertices represent islands and edges represent proposed bridges.</p>
        <p>Goal: Find a spanning tree of minimum total weight in this graph, ensuring that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have paths between all island pairs.</li>
            <li>The total construction cost is minimized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> We will not ever make cycles in our construction. The minimum cost will be obtained by picking a subset of edges that make a tree and include every vertex, thus forming a spanning tree.</p>

        <h3>If all edge weights are distinct, then the MST is unique.</h3>
        
        <h2>Kruskal's Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. It operates by sorting all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights and adding them one by one to the spanning tree, ensuring that no cycles are formed, until the tree spans all vertices.</p>
        <pre>
            1. sort edges by weight in ascending order
            2. T = empty set
            3. loop over the edges in sorted order
            if adding the edge to T does not create a cycle in T,
            then go ahead and add it to T
            4. return T
        </pre>
        <p>Using DFS for cycle checking</p>
        <p>The bottleneck is the sorting step.</p>

        <h2>Union-Find (Disjoint-Set) Data Structure</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Union-Find data structure, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), efficiently tracks a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It supports two primary operations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>find</strong>: Identifies the subset containing a given element.</li>
            <li><strong>union</strong>: Merges two subsets into a single subset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These operations are implemented using a tree-like structure that employs path compression and union by rank to ensure almost constant time complexity.</p>
        <h3>Application in Kruskal's Algorithm</h3>
        <h4>Algorithm Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Initialize an empty graph that will eventually hold the MST.</li>
                <li>Sort all edges of the graph in non-decreasing order by weight.</li>
                <li>Select edges in sorted order and apply the union-find structure to check and merge sets without forming cycles.</li>
                <li>Terminate when the MST contains \( V-1 \) edges, where \( V \) is the number of vertices.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Justification</h3>
        <p>Kruskal's algorithm, a greedy approach, utilizes the union-find structure to manage the sets of vertices. Edges are added to the MST only if they connect disjoint sets, ensuring no cycles are created and the resulting graph is a minimum spanning tree.</p>

        <h2>Kruskal's Algorithm with Union-Find</h2>
        <p>1. Sort edges by ascending order of weights</p>
        <p>Add edges to tree in order: skip an edge if it create cycles</p>
        <pre>
            for each v in V
                makeset(v)
            sort edges ascendingly by weight
            for each (u,v) in E:
                if find(u) != find(v):
                    add(u,v) to MST
                    union(u,v)
            return MST
        </pre>
        <p>Do it by hand: actually write down the edges in nonincreasing order, e.g. (A,B), (B,C), (C,B)</p>
        <p>Create a boolean array to store the edges in nonincreasing order (edges are headers / indices) & the edge is a part of MST if true.</p>
        <p>Step 1: Set = (A,B),C</p>
        <p>Step 2: Set = (A,B,C)</p>
        <p>Step 3: (C,B) already has both vertices in the set, so it creates a cycle. We do not add (C,B).</p>

        
        <h2>Prim's Algorithm</h2>
        <pre>
            Initialize the shortest array and the pred array
            Initialize a heap Q to contain all the vertices and use the shortest[v] for the key
            while Q is not null {
                u = deleteMin(Q)
                for all v in adj(u) {
                    if v in Q and weight(u, v) < shortest[v] {
                        shortest[v] = weight(u, v)
                        pred[v] = u
                    }
                }
            }
        </pre>
        <p>When the algorithm terminates, the min-priority queue Q is empty; the minimum spanning tree A for G is thus {{v, pred[v]} for all v in V - r}</p>
        <p>Similar to Dijkstra and greedy algorithms, build the MST by repeatedly finding the min cost to connect isolated vertices from the current frontier</p>
        <p>Once a vertex has been removed from the priority queue and included in the MST, its key value is considered final and not subject to further updates. This is because the key value represents the minimum cost needed to add the vertex to the MST, and once added, that vertex's inclusion is permanent.</p>

        <h2>Kruskal vs Prim</h2>
        <p>Kruskal's algorithm: maintains several connected components and guarantees eventual connectivity.</p>
        <p>Prim's algorithm: grows a tree out of one vertex. Always has only one tree growing.</p>
        <h3>Runtime Comparison</h3>
        <p>Prim has the same runtime as Dijkstra: O((V+E)log V) = O(E log V)</p>
        <p>Kruskal: sorting controls runtime. Usually O(E log E)</p>
                        <p>We know due to connected graph input that V = O(E). There are more edges than vertices.</p>
        <h3>In graphs why is O(log E) = O(log V)?</h3>
                        <p>m is at most n^2. log n = 2 log n</p>
                        <p>Prim and Kruskal have the same big-O runtime.</p>
                        <p>If you can sort faster than O(E log E), Kruskal is better.</p>

        <h2>Cut Theorem</h2>
        <p>
        The <strong>Cut Theorem</strong>, also known as the <strong>Cut Property</strong>, is a fundamental result in graph theory used particularly in the context of finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs). It provides a criterion for determining whether an edge is a part of some MST in a given graph.
    </p>
    <h3>Given:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A connected, weighted, undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \) with a weight function \( w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \).</li>
        <li>A cut \( (S, V-S) \) in \( G \), which partitions the vertex set \( V \) into two disjoint subsets \( S \) and \( V-S \).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Theorem:</h3>
    <p>
        If an edge \( e = (u, v) \in E \) is the lightest edge crossing the cut (i.e., \( u \in S \) and \( v \in V-S \)), and \( e \) has the smallest weight among all edges connecting \( S \) to \( V-S \), then this edge \( e \) is part of some Minimum Spanning Tree of \( G \).
    </p>
    <h3>Formal Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Let \( e = (u,v) \) be an edge such that \( u \in S \) and \( v \in V-S \), and suppose \( w(e) \) is less than \( w(e') \) for every other edge \( e' = (x,y) \) crossing the cut where \( x \in S \) and \( y \in V-S \). Then, there exists an MST of \( G \) that includes the edge \( e \).
    </p>
    <p>
        This theorem is a cornerstone for MST algorithms like Kruskal’s and Prim’s, as it justifies the greedy strategy of selecting the smallest weight edges that do not form a cycle, ensuring the spanning tree remains minimal in total weight.
    </p>

    <h2>Recitation Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>You have already computed a MST on some graph. Increases weight of one of the edges. How do you recompute the MST? (Rerun Kruskal/Prim is not the answer)</strong></p>
        <p>1. If the edge is not in the MST - done, do nothing.</p>
        <p>2. If the edge is in the MST - take away the changed edge & now you have 2 connected components, each of them a MST. Find edges that connect the 2 connected components. Pick the minimum edge out of all the "connected edges".</p>

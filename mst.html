    <h2>Minimum Spanning Tree</h2>
    <p>A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.</p>
    <p>Common algorithms for finding a MST include Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm.</p>

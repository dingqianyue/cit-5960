        <h2>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h2>
        <p>Given: An undirected weighted connected graph where vertices represent islands and edges represent proposed bridges.</p>
        <p>Goal: Find a spanning tree of minimum total weight in this graph, ensuring that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have paths between all island pairs.</li>
            <li>The total construction cost is minimized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> We will not ever make cycles in our construction. The minimum cost will be obtained by picking a subset of edges that make a tree and include every vertex, thus forming a spanning tree.</p>

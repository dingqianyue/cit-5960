        <h2>Coin Change Making Problem</h2>
        <p>We have coins of the following denominations: \( \{1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^i, 2^n\} \).</p>
        <p>The goal is to make change for an amount \( A \) greater than \( 2^n \) using the least number of coins.</p>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> To optimize, it makes sense to take as many \( 2^n \) coins as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Assume the "optimal solution" has \( C_0 \) coins of 1, \( C_1 \) coins of 2, \ldots, \( C_i \) coins of \( 2^i \), such that:
        \[
        C_0 \cdot 1 + C_1 \cdot 2 + C_2 \cdot 4 + \ldots + C_n \cdot 2^n = A
        \]
        Since we did not take as many \( 2^n \) coins as possible, we have:
        \[
        A - C_n \cdot 2^n \geq 2^n
        \]
        Hence, 
        \[
        C_0 + C_1 \cdot 2 + C_2 \cdot 4 + \ldots + C_{n-1} \cdot 2^{n-1} \geq 2^n
        \]
        By lemma, if this solution is optimal, none of these \( C_0, C_1, \ldots, C_{n-1} \) can be 2 or larger because 2 coins of \( 2^i \) can be replaced by just 1 coin of \( 2^{i+1} \). The sum of lower denominations is \( 2^n - 1 \), which defies the above inequality. Thus, a solution that does not use as many \( 2^n \) coins as possible cannot be optimal.</p>

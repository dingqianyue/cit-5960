        <h2>P vs NP Problems</h2>
        <h3>Polynomial-time (P) Problems</h3>
        <p>Problems where the solution can be found in polynomial time are categorized as P. Examples include sorting, searching, and shortest path algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Nondeterministic Polynomial-time (NP) Problems</h3>
        <p>An example is prime factorization, which allows for the verification of a factor of an integer in polynomial time, but no known polynomial time algorithm exists for factorizing a given integer.</p>

        <p><strong>P is a subset of NP</strong></p>

        <p>The 0/1 Knapsack problem is classified as NP-Complete. It operates in pseudo-polynomial time O(nW), where its complexity becomes exponential when inputs are binary. The dynamic programming solution is linear in the value of W, but exponential in the length of W.</p>

        <h2>Recitation 12</h3>
        <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>If the edge weights are all distinct, Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm will give the same minimum spanning tree.</strong></li>
                <p>True. There is one unique MST in this situation.</p>
            <li><strong>Given an undirected weighted connected graph and a vertex s as source, the pred array at the end of Dijkstra’s algorithm running from s and the pred array at the end of Prim’s algorithm that is run starting from s are guaranteed to be the same.</strong></li>
                <p>False. Prim’s selects minimum weights for individual edges, which can result in different pred vertices.</p>
        </ol>

        <h4>Question 2</h4>
        <p>Run Prim’s algorithm on the graph starting at vertex A.</p>

        <h4>Question 3</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding the edit distance between two strings is a problem that is in P.</li>
                <p>True. O(mn).</p>
            <li>If a problem is solvable using dynamic programming, it is definitely in P.</li>
                <p>False. Example: 0/1 Knapsack is not in polynomial time, O(n * W) = O(2^k)).</p>
            <li>To prove a problem is in P, we need to come up with the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem.</li>
                <p>False. As long as it’s polynomial time, it’s considered in P.</p>

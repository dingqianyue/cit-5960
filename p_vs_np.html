        <h2>P vs NP Problems</h2>
        <h3>Polynomial-time (P) Problems</h3>
        <p>Problems where the solution can be found in polynomial time are categorized as P. Examples include sorting, searching, and shortest path algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Nondeterministic Polynomial-time (NP) Problems</h3>
        <p>An example is prime factorization, which allows for the verification of a factor of an integer in polynomial time, but no known polynomial time algorithm exists for factorizing a given integer.</p>

        <p><strong>P is a subset of NP</strong></p>

        <p>The 0/1 Knapsack problem is classified as NP-Complete. It operates in pseudo-polynomial time O(nW), where its complexity becomes exponential when inputs are binary. The dynamic programming solution is linear in the value of W, but exponential in the length of W.</p>

        <h2>Last Recitation (12)! Friday, April 26, 2024</h2>
        <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>If the edge weights are all distinct, Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm will give the same minimum spanning tree.</strong></li>
                <p>True. There is one unique MST in this situation.</p>
            <li><strong>Given an undirected weighted connected graph and a vertex s as source, the pred array at the end of Dijkstra’s algorithm running from s and the pred array at the end of Prim’s algorithm that is run starting from s are guaranteed to be the same.</strong></li>
                <p>False. Prim’s selects minimum weights for individual edges, which can result in different pred vertices.</p>
        </ol>

        <h4>Question 2</h4>
        <p>Run Prim’s algorithm on the graph starting at vertex A.</p>
        <img src="rec12q2.jpg" alt="Recitation 12 Question 2" width="546" height="413">
        <p>Show the shortest and pred arrays.</p>

        <h4>Question 3</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding the edit distance between two strings is a problem that is in P.</li>
                <p>True. O(mn), where m is the length of string 1 and n is the length of string 2.</p>
            <li>If a problem is solvable using dynamic programming, it is definitely in P.</li>
                <p>False. Example: 0/1 Knapsack is not in polynomial time, O(n * W) = O(n * 2^k)).</p>
            <li>To prove a problem is in P, we need to come up with the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem.</li>
                <p>False. As long as it’s polynomial time, it’s considered in P.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Last Lecture! Tuesday, April 30, 2024</h2>
        <h3>Complexity Classes</h3>
    <p>\(\mathcal{P}\) - class of problems solvable in polynomial time (\(O(\text{polynomial})\)) with respect to the input size.</p>
    <h4>Input Size Conventions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Array — length of the array</li>
        <li>Graph — number of vertices and edges</li>
        <li>String — number of characters</li>
        <li>Single number — \(\log(\text{number})\)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>\(\mathcal{NP}\), \(\mathcal{NP}\)-Hard, \(\mathcal{NP}\)-Complete</p>

    <p>An \(O(nW)\) algorithm for the 0/1 knapsack problem does not categorize this problem as in \(\mathcal{P}\).</p>

    <h4>Decision Problems</h4>
    <p>A problem that yields a yes/no output.</p>
    <p>Example: Hamiltonian Path Problem</p>
    <p>Question: Given an undirected graph, does it contain a Hamiltonian path (a path that visits all vertices)?</p>

    <h4>Optimization Problems</h4>
    <p>Goals to maximize or minimize some function.</p>
    <p>Examples include shortest path, edit distance, and the 0/1 knapsack problem.</p>

    <p>Note: Solutions to decision problems can often be adapted to solve corresponding optimization problems.</p>

    <p>Consider the decision version of the 0/1 knapsack problem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input: A knapsack with a given capacity \(W\)</li>
        <li>Items each with a weight and a value</li>
        <li>Question: Is there a selection of items such that the total value is at least \(V\) without exceeding the capacity \(W\)?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>NP Definition</h4>
    <p>For decision problems: Given a "YES" instance and a "certificate" for this instance, the certificate can be verified in polynomial time.</p>

    <h4>Advice</h4>
    <p>Do not attempt to solve an \(\mathcal{NP}\) problem during an exam!</p>

    <h4>Hamiltonian Path Problem Example</h4>
    <p>Assuming a graph contains some Hamiltonian path, the certificate would be a sequence of vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verification includes checking if all vertices are present and in order, with each consecutive pair forming an edge.</li>
        <li>Using an adjacency matrix, checking if an edge exists between any two vertices is \(O(1)\).</li>
        <li>Using an adjacency list, the entire verification takes \(O(n+m)\).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>P vs NP</h4>
    <p>It is known that \(\mathcal{P}\) is a subset of \(\mathcal{NP}\). The unresolved question is whether \(\mathcal{NP}\) is a subset of \(\mathcal{P}\).</p>

    <h4>NP-Hard Problems</h4>
    <p>An NP-Hard problem is one such that if it can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in \(\mathcal{NP}\) can be reduced to it and thus solved in polynomial time.</p>

    <h4>Reduction Example</h4>
    <p>Subset sum problem: Given a set \(S = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}\) and a target \(t\), determine if there is a subset whose sum equals \(t\).</p>
    <p>Partition problem: Can \(S\) be divided into two subsets with equal sums?</p>

        <h2>P vs NP Problems</h2>
        <h3>Polynomial-time (P) Problems</h3>
        <p>Problems where the solution can be found in polynomial time are categorized as P. Examples include sorting, searching, and shortest path algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Nondeterministic Polynomial-time (NP) Problems</h3>
        <p>An example is prime factorization, which allows for the verification of a factor of an integer in polynomial time, but no known polynomial time algorithm exists for factorizing a given integer.</p>

        <p><strong>P is a subset of NP</strong></p>

        <p>The 0/1 Knapsack problem is classified as NP-Complete. It operates in pseudo-polynomial time O(nW), where its complexity becomes exponential when inputs are binary. The dynamic programming solution is linear in the value of W, but exponential in the length of W.</p>

        <h2>Recitation 12</h3>
        <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>If the edge weights are all distinct, Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm will give the same minimum spanning tree.</strong></li>
                <p>True. There is one unique MST in this situation.</p>
            <li><strong>Given an undirected weighted connected graph and a vertex s as source, the pred array at the end of Dijkstra’s algorithm running from s and the pred array at the end of Prim’s algorithm that is run starting from s are guaranteed to be the same.</strong></li>
                <p>False. Prim’s selects minimum weights for individual edges, which can result in different pred vertices.</p>
        </ol>

        <h4>Question 2</h4>
        <p>Run Prim’s algorithm on the graph starting at vertex A.</p>

        <h4>Question 3</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding the edit distance between two strings is a problem that is in P.</li>
                <p>True. O(mn).</p>
            <li>If a problem is solvable using dynamic programming, it is definitely in P.</li>
                <p>False. Example: 0/1 Knapsack is not in polynomial time, O(n * W) = O(2^k)).</p>
            <li>To prove a problem is in P, we need to come up with the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem.</li>
                <p>False. As long as it’s polynomial time, it’s considered in P.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Last Lecture! Tuesday, April 30, 2024</h3>
        <p>P - class of problems with O(polynomial) with respect to input size</p>
        <h4>Input size conventions</h4>
        <p>Array — length</p>
        <p>Graph — # of vertices, # of edges</p>
        <p>String — # of chars</p>
        <p>***Single num — log(number)***</p>
        <p>NP</p>
        <p>NP-Hard</p>
        <p>NP-Complete</p>
        
        <p>We know O(nW) algorithm for 0/1 knapsack does not make this problem in P.</p>
        <h4>Decision Problem</h4>
        <p>A problem that has a yes/no output</p>
        <p>e.g. Hamiltonian path problem</p>
        <p>Given a graph undirected, does this graph have a Hamiltonian path (path containing all vertices)?</p>

        <h4>Optimization Problems</h4>
        <p>Problems where goal is to maximize/minimize</p>
        <p>e.g. shortest path, edit distance, 0/1 knapsack</p>

        <p>Note - if we can solve decision problems, we can often use those solutions to solve the optimization version</p>
        <p>Consider decision version of 0/1 knapsack</p>
        <p>Inputs: given capacity W knapsack</p>
        <p>item</p>
        <p>weight</p>
        <p>value</p>

        <p>Decision version asks can we get a value >= V by filling above knapsack</p>
        <h4>Question: Does solving 0/1 decision help to solve optimization version?</h4>
        <p>0, 1, 2, ..., K (first no)</p>
        <p>Binary search</p>
        <p>min 0 or 1</p>
        <p>max sum of all values</p>

        <h4>NP - defind for decision problems in the following manner</h4>
        <p>Given a YES instance of the decision problem and a certificate of this YES instance, the certificate can be *verified* in polynomial manner.</p>
        <p>(A certificate is a string that certifies the answer to a computation.)</p>

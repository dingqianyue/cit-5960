    <h1>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node of a graph, typically the root node, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
    </p>
    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.</li>
        <li>Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.</li>
        <li>Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.</li>
        <li>Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
        BFS is used in a wide array of applications, such as finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and for web crawling by search engines.

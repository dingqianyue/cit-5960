        <h2>Coin Change Making Problem</h2>
        <p>We have coins of the following denominations: \( \{1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^i, 2^n\} \).</p>
        <p>The goal is to make change for an amount \( A \) greater than \( 2^n \) using the least number of coins.</p>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> To optimize, it makes sense to take as many \( 2^n \) coins as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Assume the "optimal solution" has \( C_0 \) coins of 1, \( C_1 \) coins of 2, \ldots, \( C_i \) coins of \( 2^i \), such that:
        \[
        C_0 \cdot 1 + C_1 \cdot 2 + C_2 \cdot 4 + \ldots + C_n \cdot 2^n = A
        \]
        Since we did not take as many \( 2^n \) coins as possible, we have:
        \[
        A - C_n \cdot 2^n \geq 2^n
        \]
        Hence, 
        \[
        C_0 + C_1 \cdot 2 + C_2 \cdot 4 + \ldots + C_{n-1} \cdot 2^{n-1} \geq 2^n
        \]
        By lemma, if this solution is optimal, none of these \( C_0, C_1, \ldots, C_{n-1} \) can be 2 or larger because 2 coins of \( 2^i \) can be replaced by just 1 coin of \( 2^{i+1} \). The sum of lower denominations is \( 2^n - 1 \), which defies the above inequality. Thus, a solution that does not use as many \( 2^n \) coins as possible cannot be optimal.</p>
        
        <h2>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h2>
        <p>Given: An undirected weighted connected graph where vertices represent islands and edges represent proposed bridges.</p>
        <p>Goal: Find a spanning tree of minimum total weight in this graph, ensuring that:
        <ul>
            <li>You have paths between all island pairs.</li>
            <li>The total construction cost is minimized.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> We will not ever make cycles in our construction. The minimum cost will be obtained by picking a subset of edges that make a tree and include every vertex, thus forming a spanning tree.</p>
        
        <h2>P vs NP Problems</h2>
    <h3>Polynomial-time (P) Problems</h3>
    <p>Problems where the solution can be found in polynomial time are categorized as P. Examples include sorting, searching, and shortest path algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Nondeterministic Polynomial-time (NP) Problems</h3>
    <p>An example is prime factorization, which allows for the verification of a factor of an integer in polynomial time, but no known polynomial time algorithm exists for factorizing a given integer.</p>

    <p><strong>P is a subset of NP</strong></p>

    <p>The 0/1 Knapsack problem is classified as NP-Complete. It operates in pseudo-polynomial time O(nW), where its complexity becomes exponential when inputs are binary. The dynamic programming solution is linear in the value of W, but exponential in the length of W.</p>

    <h3>Recitation 12: Review Questions</h3>
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>If the edge weights are all distinct, Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm will give the same minimum spanning tree.</strong> True. There is one unique MST in this situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Given an undirected weighted connected graph and a vertex s as source, the pred array at the end of Dijkstra’s algorithm running from s and the pred array at the end of Prim’s algorithm that is run starting from s are guaranteed to be the same.</strong> False. Prim’s selects minimum weights for individual edges, which can result in different pred vertices.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <p>Run Prim’s algorithm on the graph starting at vertex A.</p>

    <h4>Question 3: Review</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the edit distance between two strings is a problem that is in P (True, O(mn)).</li>
        <li>If a problem is solvable using dynamic programming, it is definitely in P (False. Example: 0/1 Knapsack is not in polynomial time, O(n * W) = O(O * 2^k)).</li>
        <li>To prove a problem is in P, we need to come up with the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem (False. As long as it’s polynomial time, it’s considered in P).</li>

        <h2>Coin Change Making Problem</h2>
        <p>We have coins of the following denominations: \(\{1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^i, 2^n\}\).</p>
        <p>The goal is to make change for an amount \(A\) greater than \(2^n\) using the least number of coins.</p>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> To optimize, it makes sense to take as many \(2^n\) coins as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Assume the "optimal solution" has \(C_0\) coins of 1, \(C_1\) coins of 2, \ldots, \(C_i\) coins of \(2^i\), such that:
        \[
        C_0 \cdot 1 + C_1 \cdot 2 + C_2 \cdot 4 + \ldots + C_n \cdot 2^n = A
        \]
        Since we did not take as many \(2^n\) coins as possible, we have:
        \[
        A - C_n \cdot 2^n \geq 2^n
        \]
        Hence, 
        \[
        C_0 + C_1 \cdot 2 + C_2 \cdot 4 + \ldots + C_{n-1} \cdot 2^{n-1} \geq 2^n
        \]
        By lemma, if this solution is optimal, none of these \(C_0, C_1, \ldots, C_{n-1}\) can be 2 or larger because 2 coins of \(2^i\) can be replaced by just 1 coin of \(2^{i+1}\). The sum of lower denominations is \(2^n - 1\), which defies the above inequality. Thus, a solution that does not use as many \(2^n\) coins as possible cannot be optimal.</p>
        
        <h2>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h2>
        <p>Given: An undirected weighted connected graph where vertices represent islands and edges represent proposed bridges.</p>
        <p>Goal: Find a spanning tree of minimum total weight in this graph, ensuring that:
        <ul>
            <li>You have paths between all island pairs.</li>
            <li>The total construction cost is minimized.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> We will not ever make cycles in our construction. The minimum cost will be obtained by picking a subset of edges that make a tree and include every vertex, thus forming a spanning tree.</p>
